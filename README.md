## Analyzing Financial Records
In this project, I used Python to analyze the financial records of a company. I began by importing the dataset called "budget_data.csv," which consists of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses." By running my Python script, I performed the following calculations:

- Determined the total number of months included in the dataset.
- Calculated the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Analyzed the changes in "Profit/Losses" throughout the entire period, including the average change.
- Identified the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- Identified the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

Based on my analysis, here are the key findings:

Moreover, I displayed the analysis on the terminal and exported the results to a text file.

## Modernizing Vote-Counting
In this project, I helped a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process using a Python script. The dataset I worked with was named "election_data.csv" and contained three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate." By executing my Python script, I performed the following calculations:

- Calculated the total number of votes cast.
- Created a comprehensive list of candidates who received votes.
- Calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Determined the total number of votes each candidate received.
- Identified the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

Here are the results of my analysis:

Similar to the PyBank project, I displayed the analysis on the terminal and exported the results to a text file.

Throughout both projects, I utilized various Python functionalities, such as importing CSV modules, reading and writing files, storing data in variables, lists, and dictionaries, iterating through data structures, and implementing error handling. To tackle the tasks, I broke them down into smaller objectives and ensured that my code worked seamlessly with the provided datasets.
